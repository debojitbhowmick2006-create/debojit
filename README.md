# ðŸŽ¨ ToneChain

> **Immutable Colour Ownership Ledger â€” Claim Your Tone on the Blockchain**

---

## ðŸ§© Project Description

**ToneChain** is a simple, beginner-friendly Solidity project that demonstrates how immutable ownership can be represented directly on-chain.  
Each unique **HEX colour** (e.g., `#FF0000`) can be *claimed* by one Ethereum address â€” forever.

Once a colour is claimed, it cannot be changed, transferred, or reclaimed â€” making the blockchain an unalterable **registry of colour ownership**.

ToneChain is designed to help new developers understand Solidity fundamentals such as:
- State variables  
- Mappings  
- Events  
- Basic ownership logic  

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Lets anyone **claim a unique colour** by its HEX code.  
- Stores that ownership **immutably on-chain**.  
- Prevents multiple people from claiming the same colour.  
- Allows anyone to **query** who owns a given colour.

Think of it as a **digital colour registry** â€” each tone belongs to someone, permanently recorded on the blockchain.
